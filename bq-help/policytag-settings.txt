Masked Reader: The principals can query the table, but will see masked data in the tagged columns. A common use case is when analysts are assigned the Masked Reader role. In this case, we recommend hashes as a data masking rule to allow analysts to demonstrate the change in the PII field without accessing the content of the field.
Fine-Grained Reader: The principals can query the table and read the data. Referring back to the previous use case, this role is not supposed to be given to analysts, but to a group that needs the tagged information, i.e. calling the phone number, sending an email, creating an invoice for the given address, etc.
