# what do i do
- I manage the PCH Data foundation Platform
  - Manage the cloud based bigdata infrastructure for data processing
  - Establish architecture,data and security standards and rollo out best practices
  - Manage the foundational services and tools for the data platform team and analytics team.

  # Our business Challenge
  - Process petabytes of data across various business segements.
  - Provide near real-time data to downstream systems and teams.
  - Power analytics ,data science, and executive reporting to dervie insights

# quick look at the scale of level we operate(platform at scale)

# Design Considerations for data processesing
- Support for data mesh architecture
- Multi-tenancy and parallelism
- High availability and reliability
- Cost optimization and pre-emptive scaling
- Observability--logging monitoring,metrics
- Secitrity posture
- Applications and integrations

# Principles of Data Mesh-- A decentralized sociotechnical approach in managing and accessing analytical data at scale.
- Clear Ownership of Data Domain ownerships
- Data as as Product
- Self Service data infra-structure
- Federated Computational Governance(automating most of the governace principles)
- A successful product is Usable,Valuable and Feasible.
- Baseline for Data Usability-- It shud be Discoverable, Understandable,Addressable,Secure,Interoperable,Trustworthy,Natively Accessible and Valuable on its own
- Earlier it was rule based system now moved to ML based system based models
- Relationship to data inverted like Logic|function apply to Data and now Data drive the insights when exposed to ML models (Data Generative Function-data driven)
